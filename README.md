# SoundTap
SoundTap records your desktop's internal audio just by hitting start &amp; stop. It's clean, and lightweight.

# How It Works
SoundTap saves what you capture as a WAV file to a folder that it creates on your desktop called "SoundTap Recordings".

Great for musicians who do a lot of sampling, podcasters, journalists, YouTubers, influencers, posters, or anyone who just wants to save some sound clips for later without hassle.

It's a single python scrpit that utilizes the pyaudio library for it's logic and tkinter for its GUI.

It's also the first program that I created which I use regularly.
