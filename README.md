`pip install pyaudio`

SoundTap records your desktop computer's audio using simple start & stop buttons.

Designed for ease of use, pressing "START" records audio and pressing "STOP" saves it as a .WAV audio file to a folder on your desktop called "SoundTap Recordings".

It is great for musicians, podcasters, or anyone who just wants to record and save computer audio without hassle.

___SoundTap is part of a larger project study focused on Large Language Model code & reasoning methodology.
The project seeks to understand how various criteria in LLM prompting effects different outcomes.
It is one of many.
This program itself is not the result of a single prompt but rather uses LLM technology to build biolerplate frameworks which are then refined into a product.
This version, for example, utilizes pyaudio and tkinter. Other project schema may not.___
