SoundTap records your desktop's system audio using simple start & stop buttons.

Designed for ease of use, it captures audio and saves it as a WAV to a folder it creates on your desktop called "SoundTap Recordings".

Great for musicians who do a lot of sampling, or anyone who just wants to save some sound without hassle.
