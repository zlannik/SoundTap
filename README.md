# What Is SoundTap
SoundTap records your desktop's internal audio by clicking "start" & "stop" buttons. It's clean, lightweight, and handy.

# How It Works
SoundTap saves what you capture as a WAV file to a folder that it creates on your desktop called "SoundTap Recordings".

Great for musicians who do a lot of sampling, podcasters, journalists, YouTubers, influencers, posters, or anyone who just wants to save some sound clips for later without hassle.

It's a single python scrpit that utilizes the pyaudio library, and tkinter for its GUI. It uses multi-threading & redunancy techniques to ensure stability.

It's also the first program I have created which I use regularly.
