Designed for ease of use, pressing "START" records audio and pressing "STOP" saves it as a .WAV audio file to a folder on your desktop called "SoundTap Recordings".

It is great for musicians, podcasters, or anyone who just wants to record and save computer audio without hassle.

I love this little program that I made! The boilerplate was built with Claude and refined in Visual Studio. The cool thing is that it works great and I use it all the time to record audio!

It relies on TKinter for its GUI interface, which is okay but tbh if I were making something like this from scratch I would probably design in C
